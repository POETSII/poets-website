We are offering PhD Studentships to carry out research in all hardware and software aspects of POETS research. A collaborative approach to research will be vital within POETS and candidates will be expected to work closely with researchers from partner institutions, this will include visits to industrial collaborators sites and internships. The studentships offered include tuition fees and an annual stipend.

Candidates with an excellent qualification in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electronics or a related discipline are encouraged to apply early. You are encouraged in the first instance to send your CV and a short (1-page max) description of your academic achievements, expertise and interests in the design and validation of embedded system to a relevant email, which can be found in project details:
