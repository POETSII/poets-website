_(Copied from PRiME website, please revise)_

We are offering PhD Studentships for 3.5 years with an expected start date of October 2014 to carry out research in all hardware and software aspects of PRiME research. This will include, but not limited to, investigations within the areas of energy-efficient and reliable hardware architectures, run-time management algorithms, operating systems for mobile systems, modelling and performance analysis and profiling tools for many-core systems. A collaborative approach to research will be vital within PRiME and candidates will be expected to work closely with researchers from partner institutions, this will include visits to industrial collaborators sites and internships. The studentships offered include tuition fees and an annual stipend (currently £13,726 pa).

Candidates with an excellent qualification in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electronics or a related discipline are encouraged to apply early. You are encouraged in the first instance to send your CV and a short (1-page max) description of your academic achievements, expertise and interests in the design and validation of embedded system to a relevant email, see the individual project details:
