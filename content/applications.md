##### Event-based Micromagnetic Simulation of Spintronic Devices

POETS - Partial Ordered Event Triggered Systems - technology is based on the idea of an extremely large number (millions) of small cores, embedded in a fast, bespoke, hardware, parallel communications infrastructure - the core mesh. Inter-core communication is asynchronous, and effected by small, fixed size, hardware data packets (a few bytes) - messages. For an important set of industrial problems, POETS architectures are capable of delivering orders of magnitude speed increases at significantly lower power levels. This project is about accelerating a simulation application using POETS.

Moore's Law is the observation that, on a dense integrated circuit, the number of transistors doubles every two years. While this pace has slowed since the original observation in 1965, reducing the size of devices is still a strong design constraint, along with reducing the power required to operate them.

Regarding data storage in computers, hard drives magnetise regions of the space either "up" or "down" into magnetised domains. Spintronics research over the last decade has realised several alternative potential data carriers, such as skyrmions and magnons, which are both considerably smaller in size, and require less energy to drive through a material. If these properties can be exploited, the size and power requirements of devices can be reduced considerably. The micromagnetic model (a mathematical model) can be used to simulate spintronic devices. However, present computing technology imposes a practical restriction on the size of these models, restricting the scope for designing these devices.

The objective of this project is to develop an application for POETS to perform micromagnetic simulations of these potential data carriers (skyrmions and magnons), which in turn will inform the design of spintronic devices.
