<p>POETS (Partial Ordered Event Triggered Systems) technology is based on the
idea of an extremely large number of small cores, embedded in a fast,
hardware, parallel communications infrastructure - _the core mesh_. Inter-core
communication is effected by small, fixed size, hardware data packets (a few
bytes) - aka _messages_.</p>

<p>The POETS project describes research to investigate and prototype a software
methodology and associated hardware platform to realise the potential of this
architecture.</p>

<p>The physical implementation of such a system imposes a fixed and finite
topology on the core graph, but a thin (hardware) layer on top of the cores
allows the user to virtualise an arbitrary connectivity graph on top of the
physical one. Once this is done, the mapping of problem domain to processor
mesh follows naturally.</p>
