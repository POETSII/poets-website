**19-23 March 2018**: Newcastle team and e-Therapeutics exhibit the drug discovery accelerator at the DATE'2018 conference in Dresden, Germany

We are presenting an FPGA accelerator for network analysis based on a minified
version of POETS at DATE'2018 in Dresden, Germany. The accelerator consists of
a single FPGA chip and can perform average shortest path computations on a
large protein-protein interaction network (a protein interactome) consisting
of 3487 nodes (proteins) and 58,000 edges (interactions). The simplicity of
core/message definitions and immense degree of parallelism allows the
accelerator to achieve speed ups of up to 2505x compared to a software
implementation. Speeding up network analysis (protein interaction networks in
particular) by this amount has a significant impact on application domains
such as computational drug discovery where our industrial partner
e-Therapeutics rely heavily on network analytics to identify candidate drugs.
